# BillMate-2

After learning a great deal about C# and UWP, I decided to go back and re-write the app using better code and organization.  Trying to implement interfaces and a little bit of MVVM.  

Unfortunately I will no longer be developing this as UWP again is going to the wayside for MAUI and WinUI3.
